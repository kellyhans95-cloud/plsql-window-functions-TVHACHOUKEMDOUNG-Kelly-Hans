Business Context 

Joie du Peuple, a company in the beverage distribution industry, specializes in selling drinks such as beer and juice. The sales and marketing department aims to gain a deeper understanding of product performance across various regions and time periods.

Data Challenge 

Although the company collects transaction data regularly (including customer information, products, sales dates, and amounts), it is challenging to identify the best-selling drinks by region and track monthly sales growth. In addition, the company struggles to segment customers effectively for targeted marketing campaigns

Expected Outcome 

By applying PL/SQL window functions, the company expects to identify top-performing drinks, monitor sales growth trends, calculate running totals, and segment customers into categories that will support smarter marketing and sales strategies.
